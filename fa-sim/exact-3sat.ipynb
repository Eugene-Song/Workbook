    "A famous NP-complete problem is 3-SAT. It is a problem in finding an assignment of truth values to \n",
    "variables so that a certain logical formula evaluates true. The logical formula has a restricted \n",
    "format. It must be in _Conjunctive Normal Form_, and furthermore, each conjunct must have exactly \n",
    "three terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a formula is in _Conjunctive Normal Form_ it is an \"and\" (conjunction) over a collection of\n",
    "clauses, and each clause is an \"or\" (disjunction) over a collection of variables or their negations.\n",
    "A simple example is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(a \\lor b \\lor \\neg c) \\land ( \\neg a \\lor e \\lor \\neg f) \\land ( f \\lor \\neg a \\lor c)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this example is actually in our 3-SAT form, as each of the clauses has exactly three\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _satisfying assignment_ is a way of assigning values to the variables so that the formula\n",
    "calculates out to true. This means that for each of the clauses, at least one of the three\n",
    "variables must be either not negatated and the variable assigned true, or negated and the variable\n",
    "assigned false.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above formula is true when a is set true, f is set false and c is set true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-SAT is in NP\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a satisfying assignment it is polynomial time to verify that the formula calculates out\n",
    "to true with that assignment. The code to do this is in the Exact3SAT class, the verify method. \n",
    "You can work out the run time and make sure you understand it is polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can find a satisfying assignmentby bruit-force - trying every truth combination for\n",
    "all the variables in the formula. There are an exponential number of possibilities for truth\n",
    "assignments, but if the immense amount of time is not an issue, an assignment will be found, \n",
    "if one exists, and the search will definitively halt with a negative result if no truth assignment\n",
    "exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search solution adopted here is not much better than bruit search. The search scans the clauses\n",
    "in the order presented, building up a collection of truth assignments to make each clause true as\n",
    "it is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses recursion based on attempting to make a particular clause evaluate true, indicated\n",
    "by the variable in the code \"clause_number\", and the recurse in clause_number+1. The result from the\n",
    "recursion is either True, meaning the recursion managed to complete the variable assignment to make\n",
    "clause clause_number+1 and all following clauses evaluate true, or returns False, meaning it could not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If True, since the clause at clause_number has been made to evaluate true, true is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "If False, then a different way to make clause_number true is tried. If after trying all ways to make\n",
    "clause_number true, and for none of them does the recursive call for clause_number+1 returns True, return\n",
    "False.\n",

    "### Reducing general SAT to 3-SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-SAT is NP-complete. Meaning that it is first in NP; and second, any problem in NP can be turned into a problem in 3-SAT. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example is the general SAT problem for Conjunctive Normal Form, where the clauses are not restricted to exactly tree variables. There could be greater, or fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project is to write a reduction so that a general SAT problem turns into a 3-SAT problem, such that solving that 3-SAT gives a solution to the original SAT. At the same time, if the original SAT as no solution, also the 3-SAT have no solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general theory of NP-completeness means that any problem in NP can have a reduction to 3-SAT, often first by reducing it to SAT. The intuitive reason that any problme in NP can be reduced to SAT, is that in the end, any problem that a computer can solve is really about an enormous boolean formula for which truth values are needed so that the formula comes out right. In the end, that is all a computer does. Find satisfying assignments to big logical formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there the logical formulas must be transformed into SAT, and then into 3-SAT. The composite then is that the original problem is not a problem in 3-SAT solvable if an if the original problem was solvable, and often the satisfiying assignment (if any) can be read backwards to give the solution to the original problem.\n",
