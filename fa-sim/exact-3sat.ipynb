    "\n",
    "An algorithm solves a problem. It might be an efficient algorithm, full of clever ideas for the \n",
    "solution, or an inefficient algorithm but that gets the job done. It does not produce wrong answers,\n",
    "just might consume more resource than is theoretically needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem SAT is a problem in solving a boolean formula. By solution, it is meant, that the \n",
    "formula has lots of variables and one searches for a setting of the variables True or False so that\n",
    "the computed value of the formula is True. The values assigned is a called a _satisfying assignment_.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very general problem, because a lot of stuff boils down to a boolean formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, SAT simplifies the ask in a way which is not essential by restricting the form of the formula.\n",
    "It must be in _Conjunctive Normal Form_ (CNF). A boolean formula has three operations, AND, OR and NOT. The\n",
    "AND is also called a conjunction and the OR is also called a disjunction. A disjunct is \n",
